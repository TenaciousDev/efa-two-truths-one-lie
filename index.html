        <h3>Lived Abroad</h3>
        <p>
          I lived in the Philippines for a while, during my teenage years in the
          late 90s and early 00s.

        <h3>Petting Zoo</h3>
        <p>
          I have two dogs, four cats, a cockatiel, and a Reticulated Python at
          home.

        <h3>Teenage Nerdface</h3>
        <p>
          When I was 14 I started learning HTML & CSS so I could build fansites
          for my favorite TV shows, on a platform called GeoCities.
